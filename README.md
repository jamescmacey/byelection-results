# byelection-results
This is the client used at [election.wheretheystand.nz](https://election.wheretheystand.nz) to show election results as they are released on election night. It was quite rushed â€” so before the 2023 General Election (or possibly before a potential 2022 Rongotai by-election) I will have to tidy it up significantly.

Currently it's hard-coded for the Tauranga by-election, but the plan is for it to be modified so that its configuration is entirely set by the server with no further commits needed for this site. 

It's built using Nuxt 3, and uses Bootstrap as its CSS library. My original plan was to use Tailwind, but I've never used this before and time was fast running out when I wrote this.
